## Why are we using Axios?
- GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- Add authentication to each request
- Set timeouts if requests take too long
- Configure defaults for every request
- Intercept requests to create middleware
- Handle errors and cancel requests properly
- Properly serialize and deserialize requests & responses 
- And moreâ€¦
